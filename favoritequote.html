		My Favorite Quotes
	<p>
		It takes many good deeds to build a good reputation, and only one bad one to lose it. <br/>
								-Benjamin Franklin <br/> <br/>
		Money has never made man happy, nor will it, there is nothing in its nature to produce happiness. The more of it one has the more one wants. <br/>
								-Benjamin Franklin <br/><br/>
		By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.
								-Benjamin Franklin <br/><br/>
